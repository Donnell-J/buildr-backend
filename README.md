# How to Run the back-end Locally:
Firstly, cd into the backend's directory and run: 
```pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The above installs all pip packages and their version used by the backend, built in Python 3.9
It *may* be necessary to make sure you are using the same python version.

Simply launch **main.py** after installing the packages, and the API will be avaialble at http://localhost:9999
